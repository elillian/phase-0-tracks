# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is keeping a system organized, it's hella useful because coding is a huge mess. Organization is your friend.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch in Github is like a side project from the master branch. The branch allows you to test and try to fix a problem before adding it to the master branch. It's a great way to build and test something before adding it to the master.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit in Github means you want to record changes to the repository so you better be 100% sure. 

* What is a merge conflict?
When you pull from a branch or combine 2 branches they merge. Sometimes you may get a merge conflict message when doing this. Fix the conflicts and then commit the result.
