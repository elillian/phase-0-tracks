<h3>GPS 1.2 HTML Reflect</h3>
<p>The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags is. I think the following tags are most useful: html, header, title, body, nav. The order the browser uses to display elements is HTML5, which is a language that helps the browser read what I engineers writes such as div, h1, h2, h3, p, etc. In this challenge with sublime I learned how to create trigger and sublime snippets. Yes, I will create more handy snippets in the future. The most difficult concept in this challenge to me was the order of how the HTML should be placed in a page. I can improve by more practice.</p>
